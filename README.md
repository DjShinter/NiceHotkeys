# Installation

To install the "**Nice Hotkeys Mod**" place "**NiceHotkeys.dll**" inside your "Mods" folder located in **ChilloutVR** > **Mods**

# Plans for the Mod

I plan to add hotkeys that people tend to like, and so you can feature request it in https://forums.abinteractive.net/t/feature-requests and I might include it in while scouting for mods to create also something to update this with a config you can set so you can change the hotkeys and even disable certain functions, for now if you want to do this you can build this version yourself and change the keys and/or remove the code that has the function.

# Developer Note

If this mod breaks terms of service, I will shutdown this project immediately as soon as I get note regarding about this, but I believe that this is a quality of life change.

# Building this project

I'm not going to provide "**MelonLoader.dll**" & game files related to ChilloutVR, this is on you!

Download the Source Code and reference "**MelonLoader.dll**" & "**Assembly-CSharp.dll**" & "**UnityEngine.InputModule.dll**" & "**UnityEngine.InputLegacyModule.dll**".

# Is this mod not allowed?

**Any modifications that are not approved** can get your **ABI account terminated** and such this modification is following the "modding guidelines" at the best it could be.

**They reserve the right to punish users using my mod**.

If you are scared of using modifications in your game **do not install mods**.

Official post regarding Modding: https://forums.abinteractive.net/d/107-developer-update-6

- **You may only create modifications for the purpose of improving the game**. Malicious intent is and will be punished in any case we deem necessary to take action on.

- **Mod sources have to be public so that users can build their own version and read through the code** for security reasons.

Two problems regarding the game guidelines is:

**Distribution of game code is strictly prohibited**.
**You may never distribute decompiled game code**.

**In the code I have distributed** a function that is decompiled, but **without this function this modification would not work**, This mod was created as a challenge to the modding guidelines and such is not an attack to the company, but advising for revising the modding guidelines.

But it also says in the particular statements of their official guidelines in their official website that states the following:

**ยง5.2 We allow modding of our games and access to our API as long as the guidelines are met. Malicious modifications or game changing modifications without permission are a violation of the terms of service and strictly forbidden.**

which states that modding is allowed, since the guidelines have been updated in the forum post.

In here it states:

**ยง5.7 Spreading modified versions of our code without our allowance is strictly forbidden.** (Basically to not create any mods that affect their code, so you still require permission to publish, **which I believe in the long run this is stressful task for the company to look at every distributed modification of their game and approve each one**, I believe that if it is following the guidelines it should be permissible at best and if it is **disapproved or declined to be shutdown immediately**)

**ยง5.8 You may not reverse engineer our games.** (In this case you wouldn't be able to create a mod at all, meaning you wouldn't be able to really create a quality of life mod if that is the case since you won't be allowed to interact with anything regarding the game, and unfortunately guessing the game mechanics is not a viable option either)
