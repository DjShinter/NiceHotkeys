# Installation

To install the "**Nice Hotkeys Mod**" place "**NiceHotkeys.dll**" inside your "Mods" folder located in **ChilloutVR** > **Mods**

# Plans for the Mod

I plan to add hotkeys that people tend to like, and so you can feature request it in https://forums.abinteractive.net/t/feature-requests and I might include it in while scouting for mods to create also something to update this with a config you can set so you can change the hotkeys and even disable certain functions, for now if you want to do this you can build this version yourself and change the keys and/or remove the code that has the function.

# Developer Note

If this mod breaks terms of service, I will shutdown this project immediately as soon as I get note regarding about this, but I believe that this is a quality of life change.

# Building this project

I'm not going to provide "**MelonLoader.dll**" & game files related to ChilloutVR, this is on you!

Download the Source Code and put the DLL's in /Libs which are: "**MelonLoader.dll**" & "**Assembly-CSharp.dll**" & "**UnityEngine.InputModule.dll**" & "**UnityEngine.InputLegacyModule.dll**", "**UnityEngine.PhysicsModule.dll**".

# Is this mod not allowed?

Official post regarding Modding: https://documentation.abinteractive.net/official/legal/tos/#7-modding-our-games

§7.1 You may only create modifications for the purpose of improving the game. Malicious mods are not permitted and will be punished in any case we deem it necessary to take action on. ✅

§7.2 If you plan on publishing your mods (or release them to the CVR Workshop once available) you must release the mods sourcecode to the public (for example by using github). ✅

§7.3 Publishing obfuscated mods is not allowed. ✅ (My mod is completely open sourced and does not have any obfuscations)

§7.4 If you have to overwrite, alter or include base game scripts with your mod, **you have to request appropriate permission before releasing it to the public**. In this case we also require you to include a disclaimer that the base code of the game is owned by us. This may be a simple one-liner. ❌ (I have not received a message regarding permission yet but I have made an email regarding it to be at the very least reviewed or checked out)
